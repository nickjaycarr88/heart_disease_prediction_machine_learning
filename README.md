# **heart disease prediction-machine learning**
---
### The aim of this project is to create a machine learning web application from a data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). This data set contains a collection of data from 5 different hospitals and over 900 patients records collected. 

## Data Collection
### Once importing thr data, the standard process of checking to see what data is available, missing, data types, categorical/ numerical etc is performed. This allows me to get familiar woth the data and start generating some ideas as to what to look for.

## Data exploration
### A few different graphs were created in order to see if there are any findings between the columns offered. For this data set, as there are male and female inputs, i thought it would be a good idea to explore any possible findings from this.
